# 🐍 Payroll System (Practice Project)

### 📘 About

I’m planning to make my first Python project here on GitHub.
The goal is to build a payroll system that looks decent and works properly.
I’ll focus on the main functions first, then add designs and features later.

### 🧠 Current Progress
- [ ] practice with user inputs
- [ ] code the necessary functions

### 🚀 Future Plans

Add database for saving records

Improve interface design

Export payslips to file

### 🧑‍💻 Notes

This project is just for practice and learning.
I’ll improve it step by step as I learn more.

# ✅ Git commit in Codespaces (because my stupid ass always forget how)

git add .
git commit -m "Your message"
git push

# First time on a new branch:
git push --set-upstream origin <branch-name>

# Helpful:
git status
git log


### 🗓️ **Day 1**
> I ran into a roadblock — VS Code Spaces runs on Linux and can’t display Windows interfaces like Tkinter. I’ll continue coding locally and upload my progress later.

> Ran into a Tkinter issue — window wouldn’t appear. Turns out VS Code doesn’t always recognize files from external folders. Fix: **create your project folder inside VS Code**, paste your code there, and it works. 

> Turns out it wasn’t about creating the folder inside VS Code — the real issue was the folder name. Mine had a special character (an apostrophe '). VS Code sometimes forgets to wrap the file path in quotes, so the terminal reads the ' as part of a command and just sits there waiting forever. Removing the apostrophe fixed it instantly.

### 🗓️ **Week 1**
> Hey, ugh~ its been a while. I survived one heck of a week. but i finally have a decent start on my Payroll GUI I forgot to make an update since I mainly worked on my code at school, bla bla bla~ anyway here it is...
