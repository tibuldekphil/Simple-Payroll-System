# 🐍 Payroll System (Practice Project)

### 📘 About

I’m planning to make my first Python project here on GitHub.
The goal is to build a payroll system that looks decent and works properly.
I’ll focus on the main functions first, then add designs and features later.

### 🧠 Current Progress
- [ ] practice with user inputs
- [ ] code the necessary functions

### 🚀 Future Plans

Add database for saving records

Improve interface design

Export payslips to file

### 🧑‍💻 Notes

This project is just for practice and learning.
I’ll improve it step by step as I learn more.

### 🗓️ **Day 1**
> I ran into a roadblock — VS Code Spaces runs on Linux and can’t display Windows interfaces like Tkinter. I’ll continue coding locally and upload my progress later.

> Ran into a Tkinter issue — window wouldn’t appear. Turns out VS Code doesn’t always recognize files from external folders. Fix: **create your project folder inside VS Code**, paste your code there, and it works.
